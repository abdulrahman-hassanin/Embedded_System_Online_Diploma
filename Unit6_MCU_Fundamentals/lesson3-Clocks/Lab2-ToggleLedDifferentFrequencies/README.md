# Clock Management Unit

This project aims to use the Clock Management Unit to manage the clock rates for different peripherlas.

This is done on STM32F103C6 by configure board to run with the following rates:
- APB1 Bus Frequency 16MHZ
- APB2 Bus Frequency 16MHZ
- AHB Bus Frequency 32MHZ
- SysCLK Bus Frequency 16MHZ
- Use only internal HSI_RC

Tools:
- STM32F103C6
- STM32CubeIDE
- Uvision Simulation
